            Hi there!
            You seem to have found my little turn based game web project.
            <h3>About me</h3>
            My name is Jacob, and I am a game designer / programmer from Hamburg Germany. I am still very much at the start of my professional journey, and have much to learn.
            This project was made primarily to practice my Html, Css and Javascript skills. It is a rather complicated project, and while I have worked with these languages before,
            I doubtlessly have, all in all, done a rather poor job of it. Nonetheless I had fun working on this project, and I like to think that I have learned a fair bit.
            And you are more than welcome to check out the result!
            If you want to check out more of my work (and frankly, probably way better work), you can find it on my Itch.io page <a href="https://vonneumann.itch.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            <h3>The rules</h3>
            This is a turn based tactics game, inspired by games like Advance Wars, and Wargroove. It is played with currently exactly two players on a single device. <br>
            Each player takes command of an army, with the goal to wipe out their opponent. To that goal they can command their units to move around the map, and attack enemy units within range. 
            In addition to units, players may also control buildings, from which they can produce new units. Buildings can't be destroyed, but can be neutralized by the enemy, and can be captured 
            by infantry, while in a neutral state. <br>
            To select a unit or building simply left click on it. If it is a unit of yours, and can still perform an action on this turn, you should see several of the surrounding tiles highlighted. 
            Click on one of these to move to that tile. After moving a unit, or selecting a building you will be shown a context menu with the available actions. Many of those require you to select 
            a target as well. <br>
            Movement of units may be hampered by the terrain they are moving over. Units have different movement types, and each type of terrain shows you the movement cost for units to move through.
            When attacking an enemy unit or building, the attacking unit deals damage, then the target may retaliate, if they were attacked in melee. This means the attacker is favoured in most
            battles. The amount of damage different unit types deal to one another is fixed, though there is a certain random factor added, and the result is multiplied with the unit's health.
            Healthy units are a lot more effective, so keep them safe! <br>
            You can see each units health displayed as a number in the lower right corner of their tile. Units on full health do not show a number. Though you can also see the unit health in the
            Game information panel. <br>
            Buildings also have health, though for them it serves an additional function. Recruiting units from a building consumes a little of their health. More is consumed for more powerful
            units. However, at the start of your turn all of your buildings replenish 20% of their maximum health. Additionally, units are recruited at the same health the building had when 
            recruiting them. You will have to balance recruiting enough units to keep the enemy at bay, with allowing your buildings to replenish their health.
